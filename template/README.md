* 1 change the name of the html file to `index.html` (the html file should be in the first level of repository)

* 2 push the necessary files to the depository (html file, the folder generated upon knitting)

* 3 the html page would be-  https://`<user or organization name>`.github.io/`<Repo name>`/

* 4 the new html uploaded to the Github will take some time to deploy, so don't panic!
