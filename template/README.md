### To deploy the html on Github


* change the name of the html file to `index.html` (the html file should be in the first level of repository)

* push the necessary files to the repository (html file, the folder generated upon knitting)

* the html page would be-  https://`<user or organization name>`.github.io/`<Repo name>`/

* it will take some time for the new html uploaded to deploy, so don't panic!
